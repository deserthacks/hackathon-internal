## Features

- Review attendee applications

## Integrating with hackathon-* projects

Eventually there'll be more info in this section, but the gist is there are other hackathon-* projects under DesertHack's GitHub [organization](https://github.com/deserthacks) that have been built to work together. [hackathon-hq](https://github.com/deserthacks/hackathin-hq) is the main backend API service.  The goal is that you can pick the best parts and ideas you like and build it in to your own project.

## Running the project

The project includes a live-reloading static server on port `8080`, which will build, launch, and rebuild the app whenever you change application code. To start the server, run:

```bash
$ npm start
```

If you want to just build without the live reload and build-on-each-change watcher, run:

```bash
$ npm run build
```
